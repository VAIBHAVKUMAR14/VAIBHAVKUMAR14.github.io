The Sun, also referred to as "Sol", is the
star at the center of the Solar System. Sun's
mass accounts for some 99.86% of the total
mass of the Solar System.

COMPOSITION AND GALAXY <br></div>
<div class="n">
  Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass is
  hydrogen, with the rest mostly helium. Only
  1.69% of the Sun (which is still 5 628 times
  the mass of the Earth) is made up of heavier
  elements like carbon, iron, neon and
  oxygen.Once thought to be a relatively insignificant
star, the Sun is now considered to be
brighter than about 85% of the stars in the
Milky Way galaxy. It is located about two
thirds of the way out from the centre of the
Milky Way.<br><br>
