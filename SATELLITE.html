  The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Next to
  the Sun, the Moon exerts the greatest influence on
  the Earth itself, most notably through its affect on
  Earth's tides.

MASS AND ORIGIN<br></div>
<div class="n">
  The Moon is the largest natural satelite relative to
  the size of its primary having 27% percent the
  diameter and 60% the density of the Earth. The
  Moon is larger than Pluto.
  The current prevailing hypothesis for the origin of
  the Moon is that it formed as a result of Mars-sized
  body colliding with the newly-formed proto-Earth.
  The material ejected from this impact accreted to
  form the Moon 4.53 billion years ago.<br><br>
