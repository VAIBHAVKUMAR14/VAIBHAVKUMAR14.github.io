<div class="n">


about 71 % of the earth's surface is covered by salt water oceans ,
and the remaining 30% is taken up by the seven contenental landmasses . Earth's
outer surface is also divided into severals rigid segments ,
or tectonic plates , that migrate across the surface over periods
of millons of years. The earth is tilted on its axis by 23.4degree,
producing seasonal variations in climate and weather across the surface ofthe planet during
the course of a year .<br><br>
