  Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
second largest planet In the Solar System. Until the
invention of modern telescope, Saturn was regarded
as the outermost of the known planets.

  MASS AND RINGS <br></div>
<div class="n">
  Although the second largest, Saturn is the least
  dense of all the planets in the Solar System, with
  only one-eighth the density of Earth (but nine times
  its diameter). It is also the only planet that is less
  dense than water.While the other gas giants also have ring systems,
Saturn's is larger and more visible than any other in
the Solar System. The rings are composed of water
ice crystals and a smaller amount of rock, ranging in
size from specks of dust to a few particles as large as
mountains.<br><br>
